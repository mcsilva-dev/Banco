# Object-Oriented Programming Project
Welcome to this project where I am exploring and applying the concepts of object-oriented programming. As I started delving into this important aspect of the development world, the desire to apply these concepts emerged. This project marks my initial steps towards mastering the techniques of object-oriented programming.

Purpose
The primary purpose of this project is to serve as a practical application of object-oriented programming principles. It does not rely on any external libraries, making it easy for you to clone and run by simply executing the "main.py" file.

Upon the first run, a database with pre-defined client information will be automatically created. You can refer to the "database.csv" file to view all the stored data.

I hope you enjoy the experience! Working on this small project was not only interesting but also fun. I believe I have effectively applied object-oriented programming concepts. Feedback is appreciated.
